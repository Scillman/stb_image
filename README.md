# README
This repository contains a C++ ``stb::Image`` class that provides quick and easy access to commonly used STB image functionality. The class only supports JPEG and PNG out of the box but can be easily extended to support all STB image formats.

The ``test.cpp`` can be used to both test as well as see how to use the C++ class.

The code is written against the versions listed below and may not work in older and or newer versions of STB.
 * v2.27  stb_image
 * v0.97  stb_image_resize
 * v1.16  stb_image_write
